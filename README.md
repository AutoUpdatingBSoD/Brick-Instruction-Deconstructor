This app uses machine learning models trained on publicly available LEGOÂ® instruction imagery to help users quickly identify which parts correspond to which steps in complex instruction booklets.

The goal is not to replace official LEGOÂ® content, but to support fans, builders, and educators by reducing the time and visual strain involved in traditional instruction navigation.

Test predictions page is <a href='https://autoupdatingbsod.github.io/Brick-Instruction-Deconstructor/'>here</a>

Page and Section model pipelines are <a href='https://github.com/AutoUpdatingBSoD/Brick-Instruction-Deconstructor/releases/tag/Testing)'>here</a>.

Python dependencies needed for the section model pipeline:

```pip install tensorflow ultralytics torch```

Though torch is technically optional, all I really use it for is GPU Acceleration in Training. It would survive without it provided you really wanted to edit that part out.



A YoloV5 or YoloV8 untrained but properly labelled dataset from Roboflow is also needed
